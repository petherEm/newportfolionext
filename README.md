My new portfolio website, inspired by papareact https://www.papareact.com/ and adapted accordingly.
Portfolio built on NextJS and TailwindCSS with Sanity (sanity.io).
Honestly, I love Sanity experience and groq queries structure.
This project was my third attempt to learn TypeScript and I believe I finally got the critical understanding of TS.
